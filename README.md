# Earth's Orbit from Pulsar Signals 
Plotting the earth's orbit from pulsars J1614-2230 and J2222-0137 using python with pandas, numpy and matplotlib
This is a project I made on work experience that calculates the orbit of the earth based on residuals from pulsars J1614-2230 and J2222-0137. When ran, the project displays graphs about the timing of these pulsars and finally the orbit of the earth. This program uses pandas, matplotlib and numpy to calculate and plot these graphs.
## The Process
This is a project I created on work experience at OzGrav. This is a python program where I calculated the earth's orbit from pulsar residuals. This is an extension of other projects I'd done including retrieving data from the ATNF pulsar catalogue and visualising it. 
The first step was finding the data that we could use to make a project like this. For the data, I retrieved it from OzGrav's pulsar timing residuals and used the location to find pulsars that were located in the same plane as the orbit of the earth
