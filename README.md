# Earth's Orbit from Pulsar Signals 
Plotting the earth's orbit from pulsars J1614-2230 and J2222-0137 using python with pandas, numpy and matplotlib
This is a project I made on work experience that calculates the orbit of the earth based on residuals from pulsars J1614-2230 and J2222-0137. When ran, the project displays graphs about the timing of these pulsars and finally the orbit of the earth. This program uses pandas, matplotlib and numpy to calculate and plot these graphs.
## The Process
This is a project I created on work experience at OzGrav. This is a python program where I calculated the earth's orbit from pulsar residuals. This is an extension of other projects I'd done including retrieving data from the ATNF pulsar catalogue and visualising it. 

The first step was finding the data that we could use to make a project like this. For the data, I retrieved it from OzGrav's pulsar timing residuals and used the location to find pulsars that were located in the same plane as the orbit of the earth, and then two pulsars in this plane that were approximately 90 degrees away from each other. Choosing pulsars in these locations would mean that the orbit could be calculated by making a sort of coordinate system out of the delays in timing it took for these signals to reach earth.

After retrieving this data, I made a few basic plots of the delays in timing to get an understanding of how it looks and fits together. To convert this data to make the earth's orbit, I had to use a form of interpolation, because observations of different pulsars generally don't happen at the same. To account for this, I had to calculate the delays in pulsar signals that would be predicted to happen at a certain time, using first linear interpolation and then quadratic interpolation. I also further prepared the data by using trigonometry (because the pulsars were not precisely on the same plane as the earth), and setting the average of the data to equal zero so it could be plotted effectively.

Once the data had been cleaned, I plotted it and it showed the elliptical earth's orbit. From here I calculated the speed of the earth's orbit and attempted to create a graph that showed both the earth's position and speed (it turned out to be a messy graph that didn't reveal much about the data), and then made one that showed time of year vs the speed of the earth, which was a clear graph but it wasn't apparent why for some periods of the year it varied a lot in small bits of the overall larger pattern.
